# Mini-NGrams-Viewer

This is a project I did for UC Berkeley's CS61B data structures. It uses data from Google's Ngrams viewer (up to the year 2022), which could be downloaded from this address: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xGTZqCo5maiZjA307OPocmKDOTYlJXnz/view. 

To run the viewer, open ngordnet_2a.html from the static folder in your browser and run Main.
